# License - AAU PANDEMIC VENTILATOR

Research performed at Aalborg University has resulted in a prototype emergency pandemic ventilator. As of now, the prototype is still at the stage of research and development.

However, due to the emergency situation caused by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, Aalborg University has decided to make information and materials, including software, in relation to the prototype developed by Aalborg University available for use by third parties, in order to enable e.g. companies or health authorities to manufacture emergency ventilators on their own.

The information and materials made available by Aalborg University (the ‘Disclosed Materials) include:

1) Software design and code for controlling PLCs for regulating the ventilator [Software Repository](https://github.com/CoRescue/AAUPandemicVentilator)
2) Hardware parts list and sketch [DMR](https://github.com/CoRescue/AAUPandemicVentilator/tree/master/DMR)
3) Our application and approval from the Danish ministry (for inspiration to write your own approval documents). This includes test strategies, user manuals, risk analysis, etc. This is provided in [DHF](https://github.com/CoRescue/AAUPandemicVentilator/tree/master/DHF).

The Disclosed Materials are made available by Aalborg University subject to specific terms and conditions of use found at the present [repository](https://github.com/CoRescue/AAUPandemicVentilator). In order to be able download and access the Disclosed Materials you will be asked to acknowledge that you have read and accepted these specific terms and conditions of use.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE

Aalborg University hereby grants you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, world-wide irrevocable license to the Disclosed Materials to use, make, have made, manufacture, have manufactured and make available an emergency ventilator (‘Emergency Ventilator’) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (the ‘Purpose’).

You may reproduce, modify and distribute the software, included in the Disclosed Materials, only as needed to manufacture and make available the Emergency Ventilator.

You are free to modify and build upon the Disclosed Materials for the Purpose, provided however, that in the event you modify, transform, improve or build upon the Disclosed Materials, including the software (collectively the ‘Modifications’), you are obligated to make your Modifications available under a license that includes terms and conditions of use identical to the terms and conditions of use of the Disclosed Materials. You may not apply legal terms and conditions or technological measures that legally restrict others from using the Disclosed Materials or Modifications in accordance with these terms and conditions of use.

### Regulatory approval

In order to avoid a situation where COVID-19 patients dies due to an insufficient amount of mechanical ventilators available, the Danish Medicines Agency has exceptionally issued a limited regulatory approval of the prototype emergency pandemic ventilator developed by Aalborg University. This regulatory approval, however, only applies for use in Denmark, and furthermore the approval is limited for use in the vital treatment of COVID-19 patients with life-threatening conditions. 
The Disclosed Materials are NOT regulatory approved. If you manufacture an Emergency Ventilator based on the Disclosed Materials you acknowledge and agree to be responsible for all required regulatory approvals in each country or territory outside of Denmark in which you plan to make available or use the Emergency Ventilator, and you must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements in those jurisdictions.

### COVID-19 Warning

When making the Emergency Ventilator available for use, you must provide a warning indicating that the Emergency Ventilator has been created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and may only be used in response to the COVID19 pandemic. Furthermore, such warning shall state that the Emergency Ventilator is provided AS IS.  

Any manufacturing of an Emergency Ventilator based on the Disclosed Materials should only be for use by medical staff in intensive care units worldwide, in situations where no other options are available and all else fails, in order to try and avoid unnecessary death of COVID-19 patients.

### Name and Logo

You are not authorized to use the name or logo of Aalborg University in connection with your activities in relation to or on the Emergency Ventilator, except as required by regulatory authorities.
