# Release Notes

## Revision 1.0

This is the initial release of the AAU Pandemic Ventilator, as it was when an authorization for placing the AAU Pandemic Ventilator on the market in Denmark as a non-CE marked device.  

This authorization implies that the normal regulatory approvals has NOT been obtained for the AAU Pandemic Ventilator and, consequently the usual level of safety and efficacy that is expected for medical devices is not fulfilled for the AAU Pandemic Ventilator.  

This revision of the software was used for demonstrating control of O2 and Air proportional valves for volume controlled mechanical ventilation, and to compare the functionality of the AAU Pandemic Ventilator to a CE marked ventilator (Hamilton G5). 
This comparison involved the following settings and ranges:

* Inspiratory oxygen fraction from 21 to 100%
* Tidal volume from 250 to 600 ml
* Respiratory rate from 10 to 30 breaths per minute
* Inspiratory to expiratory ratio of 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3
* Positive end-expiratory pressure from 5 to 25 cm H2O

The results of this test are documented in [VENT-60-001-DOC Verification Specification & Report], however, there is NOT a full test coverage for all the technical requirements in [VENT-10-002-DOC Technical Requirements]. Untested technical requirements can be identified in [VENT-10-002-DOC Technical Requirements] from the absence of a Test ID in the Verification column of the requirement tables. For untested technical requirements only a test strategy has been specified. 

Testing of the AAU Pandemic Ventilator is currently ongoing, and new releases will be made available as the test coverage increases.

**CONSEQUENTLY, THIS RELEASE OF THE AAU PANDEMIC VENTILATOR IS FOR DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES ONLY.**
**SHOULD NOT BE USED DIRECTLY IN THIS FORM FOR CONTROLLING MECHANICAL VENTILATION OF PATIENTS!**
